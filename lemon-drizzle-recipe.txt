Ingredients

    225g unsalted butter, softened
    225g caster sugar
    4 eggs
    finely grated zest 1 lemon
    225g self-raising flour

For the drizzle topping

    juice 1½ lemons
    85g caster sugar
    
Method

    Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Beat together 225g softened 
    unsalted butter and 225g caster sugar until pale and creamy, then 
    add 4 eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through. Sift in 225g 
    flour, then add the finely grated zest of 1 lemon and mix until 
    well combined. Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, 
    then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.
    Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre 
    of the cake comes out clean. While the cake is cooling in its tin, 
    mix together the juice of 1 1/2 lemons and 85g caster sugar to make 
    the drizzle. Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, 
    then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar 
    will form a lovely, crisp topping. Leave in the tin until completely 
    cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 
    3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.
